# HandyInteraction

The Handy Interaction software is presented as a desktop application that is based on the detection and tracking of the 
user's hands, using a conventional camera, to allow the extraction of motion-based features in real time and facilitate 
human-computer interaction in different technological contexts. The application uses machine learning and deep learning 
models, and arises from the study of the state of the art in the use of computer vision algorithms for interaction 
design.
 
## About this Software
Handy Interaction was developed by **Antonio Escamilla Pinilla** working for the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, in 
the context of a research project entitled **MOTION-BASED FEATURE ANALYSIS FOR THE DESIGN OF FULL-BODY INTERACTIONS IN 
THE CONTEXT OF COMPUTER VISION AND LARGE VOLUME SPACES**. Project funded by the Research Center for Development and 
Innovation CIDI-UPB with number 584C-05/20-23.
