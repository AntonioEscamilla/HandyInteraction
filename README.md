# HandyInteraction

The Handy Interaction software is presented as a desktop application that is based on the detection and tracking of the 
user's hands, using a conventional camera, to allow the extraction of characteristics of the movement of these extremities, 
in real time and facilitate human-computer interaction in different technological contexts. The application uses machine 
learning and deep learning models, and arises from the study of the state of the art in the use of computer vision 
algorithms for interaction design.
